## Techniques Used

### Frontend

- *Flutter:* The app is built using Flutter, a UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
- *State Management:* We use setState for managing the state within the app. For more complex state management, you can consider using providers, BLoC, or other state management solutions.
- *Material Design:* The app follows Material Design guidelines, providing a modern and intuitive user interface.

## User Interface (UI)

The To-Do App's user interface is designed with simplicity and user-friendliness in mind:

- *Task List:* Displays all tasks in a clean, scrollable list. Each task shows its description.
- *Add Task:* A floating action button (FAB) to add new tasks quickly.
- *Edit Task:* Tapping a task opens a new screen for editing the task details.
- *Delete Task:* Swipe left or right on a task to reveal the delete option.
- *Responsive Design:* The app is responsive, providing a seamless experience on both Android and iOS devices.
